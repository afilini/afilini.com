I have experience in many fields of computer science, which makes me uniquely suited for helping you out in many different ways: I have a deep knowledge of Bitcoin (particularly the on-chain side),
but I also have experience designing L2 protocols (from a technical and game-theoretical perspective), embedded devices (hardware wallets) and running and self-hosting services in production.

For example, I can do;

- Code Review: I can review the source code of your product
- Architectural design: I can help design or review the architecture of a complex protocol built on Bitcoin
- Lectures: I can teach (1-to-1 or 1-to-many) the technical aspects of Bitcoin and other protocols built on top of Bitcoin, like Lightning Network. I can also
  teach practical lessons about programming, like the Rust language itself or other tools like rust-bitcoin and BDK
- Help with self custody: I can help you self-custody your funds, by walking you through the most critical security steps to ensure the safety of your Bitcoin
- Privacy/security review: I can review your setup to improve the security and privacy of your digital life. For example, I've been using [QubesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) for the past four years,
so I can help you set it up, as well as other security-oriented tools like [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)

If any of this points sounds interesting to you, you can book an online or in-person meeting with me. Here's how it works:

1. My hourly rate is always 100 EUR + VAT (if applicable), no matter the topic. If the meeting is in-person I may also ask you to cover my travel expenses (I'm based in northern Italy, but I also
move around a lot for Bitcoin conferences)
2. The meeting can be in English or Italian
3. You can schedule a meeting by completing the form below. After submitting it I will manually review
your request and either:
    - Accept it as-is
    - Propose a longer meeting if I feel like your request needs longer than the time you allocated
    - Cancel your request entirely if I feel like I can't help you
4. After your meeting request is accepted you will receive an email with a link to complete the payment (you can use Bitcoin, credit cards or wire transfers)
5. Once your payment is confirmed you will receive a link to join the call
