### About

I'm a developer with a few years of experience working on Bitcoin open-source projects and libraries.

I currently work as a consultant in the Bitcoin space. If you need help with anything you can [book a meeting](/book-my-time) with me.

Previously, I started the [Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)](https://bitcoindevkit.org) and [Magical Bitcoin](https://github.com/MagicalBitcoin) projects, and also
worked at [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com) and [BHB Network](https://twitter.com/BHBnetwork).

I'm currently based in Brescia, Italy.
