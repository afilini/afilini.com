### About

I'm a {{< age >}} year old developer working full time on open-source Bitcoin projects like [Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)](https://bitcoindevkit.org) and [Magical Bitcoin](https://github.com/MagicalBitcoin) thanks to a generous grant from [Brink](https://brink.dev).

Previously, I've worked at [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com) and [BHB Network](https://twitter.com/BHBnetwork).

I'm currently based in Milan, Italy.
