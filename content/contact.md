### Contact

You can contact me at my main email, `alekos.filini[at]gmail.com`.

I'm also active on Twitter with the handle [`@afilini`](https://twitter.com/afilini), on [Libera](https://libera.chat) again as `afilini` and on Signal (contact me privately for my phone number).

If you'd like to send me an encrypted email or just verify my git commits, [here](/pgp.txt) you can find my full PGP key (ID `34FDFA4F`, fingerprint `9222 07BA 3642 BE16 0216 73D2 5E8A FC30 34FD FA4F`).
